# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['john', 'will', 'janet', 'karen']
# simple for loop
# for person in people:
# print('current person: ', person)
# break out loop
# for person in people:
# print('current person: ', person)
# if person == 'janet':
# break
# continue
# for person in people:
#     if person == 'janet':
#         continue
#     print('current person: ', person)

# Range
# for i in range(len(people)):
#     print('Current person: ', people[i])

# for i in range(0, 10):
#     print('Number ', i)

# while loop
count = 0
while count <= 10:
    print("count: ", count)
    count += 1

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
